BTSR has been created as a token hosted on OpenLedger, a decentralised financial platform – in fact, the de facto BitShares 2.0platform, run with CCEDK as both the host and the registrar.

BTSR is a digital token distributed to users willing to help support and maintain BitTeaser, a decentralised advertising network.

BitTeaser is a fast-growing advertising network that operates in a similar way to Google Adwords and based on delivering ‘teaser’ ads. Revenue is generated based on services providing advertising space for websites, companies and products. It aims to become the first such initiative to be built on blockchain technology.

Ownership of BTSR allows you to make money short term participating in a monthly buyback option based on income from BitTeaser activities, as well as the possibility of realising additional income from trading the BTSR token on supporting exchanges. Long term, you are able to see your investment grow based on supply and demand, as well as having the tokens burned from every buyback thus reducing overall supply available, allowing a natural increase of value per unit.

BTSR has been created as a follow-up to the successful launch of the OBITS project which was introduced in November 2015 (see OBITS.io).

The issuer of the BTSR token is CCEDK ApS, the only bitcoin and crypto exchange in Denmark.

Public launch of BTSR
On March 11th 2016 we launch to the public a crowdsale of the token BTSR, a crypto currency based on the profits of an advertising network soon to be found on the BitShares blockchain and on OpenLedger, one of the world's first truly decentralized autonomous exchanges. Day of buyback was on May 2nd.2016

Price will increase scalable with 3-5% 2 times every 2-3 days up until launch date.

Primary BTSR Split of total supply of 53 million BTSR:

10% of BTSR will be reserved for the future Board of Directors (BoD) and will be issued separately for every agreement of minimum 2%. More information on BTSR website.
20% (10 600 000) of BTSR are issued and made available to the public via crowd sale and presale period.
30% of total amount is reserved for the BitTeaser team members (developers, managers, designers).
40% of total is reserved as performance based rewards. More information on website.
IMPORTANT note: Only 70% of BitTeaser profits will be used for the monthly buyback. Full information on site. All amounts bought back will be immediately burned, and remaining supply will then consequently be reduced.

Profit distribution from advertising platform BitTeaser (70% of generated profits):

80% of designated revenues will be used for buyback of BTSR tokens
20% of designated revenues will be added to OBITS revenues paid out either as sharedrop or as buyback. New revenue stream to OBITS token
